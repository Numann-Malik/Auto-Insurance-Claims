# Car Insurance Classification

Numann Malik

## Project Summary

We analyzed behavioral data for the customers of a car insurance company. The goal was to identify key factors that are more likely to lead a customer to filing an insurance claim (e.g. for an accident). Our stakeholder would want to determine in particular, which customers are more accident prone and hence likely to file a claim, and hence either raise their premiums or consider denying them coverage (so as to maximize their profits or minimize their losses).

## Key Visual Observations

![DD](DD.png)

Above we see that over 80% of customers who have never made an insurance claim owned their vehicle, while less than half have made a claim - supporting evidence that those who lease their vehicles are more likely to file claims with their insurance company.



From the above we can see there is a positive correlation between the number of past accidents and speeding violations. This would indicate that we should determine both for each potential customer before deciding to grant any coverage.
