# Car Insurance Classification

We analyzed behavioral data for the customers of a car insurance company. The goal was to identify key factors that are more likely to lead a customer to filing an insurance claim (e.g. for an accident). Our stakeholder would want to determine in particular, which customers are more accident prone and hence likely to file a claim, and hence either raise their premiums or consider denying them coverage (so as to maximize their profits or minimize their losses).
